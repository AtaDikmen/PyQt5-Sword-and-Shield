# PyQt5-Sword-and-Shield
This is my first PyQt5 project . I tried to visualize the sword and shield game.
I used QtDesigner for visualization.
I create avatars from https://www.avatarsinpixels.com/ and I find sword and shield image from google.



HOW TO PLAY
You have 2 movements called sword and shield.
If you choose a sword, you will deal 1-100 damage to the enemy.
If you choose a shield, you will absorb 1-100 damage from next damage.
Both players have 500 health points.
